      <h1>Welcome to Astro-Coffee@{{ conf.institution }}!</h1>

      <p>Every weekday, the {{ conf.department }} at {{ conf.institution }}
        gathers in <strong>{{ conf.building }}'s {{ conf.room }}</strong> to
        discuss the latest <a href="{{ baseurl }}/papers/today">arXiv
        astro-ph</a> posting at <strong>{{ conf.coffee_at_localtime }}</strong>
        over coffee. Visitors to the department are always welcome to join these
        discussions.</p>

      <p>This <a href="{{ baseurl }}/about">astro-coffee server</a> is meant to
        help organize the discussion. It automatically finds and highlights papers
        from local authors, and allows the community to vote for articles they
        want to talk about. New paper listings are fetched from the arXiv between
        00:30 and 00:50 UTC Monday through Friday during the week.</p>

      <p>Currently, voting on papers is open between
        <strong>{{ conf.voting_start_localtime }}</strong>
        the night before and <strong>{{ conf.voting_end_localtime }}</strong>
        the morning of Astro-Coffee. Everyone gets five votes (one per paper) to
        use as they please.</p>
